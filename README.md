# Google-search-analysis
This project demonstrates how to analyze Google search trends using the PyTrends API in Python. The project focuses on gathering search data related to the keyword "Machine Learning" and visualizing the data based on geographical interest and search trends over time. The PyTrends API allows businesses, researchers, and developers to gather insights about search queries, providing valuable information to make data-driven decisions.

**The project includes:**

- Fetching search data by region for "Machine Learning."
- Visualizing search data for the top 10 countries with the most search activity.
- Analyzing search trends over time and visualizing how interest in "Machine Learning" has evolved.
  
This analysis shows the growing global interest in machine learning, especially in specific regions such as China, Ethiopia, and India.
## Features:
- PyTrends API integration for collecting Google search data.
- Visualization of search trends by region.
- Time-series analysis of keyword searches.
